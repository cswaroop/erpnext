#### Projects

ERPNext helps you to manage your Projects by breaking them into Tasks and allocating them to different people.

#### Tasks

Project is divided into Tasks and each Task is allocated to a resource. In ERPNext, you can also create and allocate a Task independently of a Project.

To create a Task, go to Project and click on Task.
