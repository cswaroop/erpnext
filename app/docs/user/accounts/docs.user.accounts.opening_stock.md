You can upload your opening stock in the system using Stock Reconciliation. Stock Reconciliation will update your stock for a given Item on a given date for a given Warehouse to the given quantity.

Stock Reconciliation will make a “difference entry” (the difference between the system stock and the actual stock in your file) for the Item.

Tip: Stock Reconciliation can also be used to update the “value” of an Item.

To make a Stock Reconciliation, go to:

> Stock > Stock Reconciliation > New Stock Reconciliation

and follow the steps mentioned on the page.

#### Step 1: Download Template

#### Step 2: Enter Data in csv file.

The csv format is case-sensitive. Thus special care should be taken to avoid spelling errors or wrong names. Even if you do not list some quantities or valuation rates, the file will still process the data.

#### Step 3: Upload the csv file with data
