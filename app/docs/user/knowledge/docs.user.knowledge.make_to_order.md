Make-to-order is a manufacturing process in which manufacturing starts only after a customer's order is received.

The company has some standard items but the product is only made when the customer places an order. This is true for furniture, for designer gift items etc.

Manufacturing after receiving customer's orders means to start a pull-type supply chain operation because manufacturing is performed when demand is confirmed, i.e. being pulled by demand. 

In this type of manufacturing, production orders are linked to one or more sales orders.
